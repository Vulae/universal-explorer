This project is a continuation of [universal-unpacker](https://github.com/Vulae/universal-unpacker)

### NOTE: This is tool is only meant for viewing and extracting, not editing & saving!

I realized having it as just a CLI made it annoying to use, so this project is a GUI app instead.
A CLI may be implemented in the future to allow for automation of extracting.
